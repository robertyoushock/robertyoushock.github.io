        <h1>Today I learned...</h1>
        <p><br>As I began the “Today I Learned” project I ventured out to ask people just that- what did they learn today? Asking this on a college campus and to undergraduate students in their homes brought expectations of academic answers yet with the exception of a few the result was not quite as scholarly as expected. Rather, when asked this question and given a notebook and a sharpie to express themselves subjects either decided to share an attempt at displaying their comedic side or complain about the “hardships” we all seem to face (lack of sleep, their reliance on caffeine, making deadlines and so forth. Due to this I made an executive decision early on as to not too heavily direct my subjects in a way that would hinder or alter their answers beyond something that truly represents themselves. This was in part due to my lack of experience with portrait photography at the time but also to keep the integrity of their answers and how comfortably they posed intact. It instead allowed me to see what they choose to say amongst their peers. After all we all have similar class loads but some choose to have lives of living for the weekend or really loving what you do. Because of this I became fascinated more in seeing if they wanted to seriously represent themselves sharing what they learn and practice- or write some meaningless gag. Truly to me that’s the beauty of it, while I may not have a cohesive set of portraits, I have a more honest representation of their personality and that’s the true ability I’m after in the end. I feel these portraits because of the direction (or lack of) I took show a combination of the subject’s personality via their posture, their clothing and accessories and the freedom of speech allowed via a simple sharpie and a notebook. </p>
